The I2C Device Library (i2cdevlib) is a collection of uniform and well-documented
classes to provide simple and intuitive interfaces to I2C devices. Each device is
built to make use of the generic "i2cdev" class, which abstracts the I2C bit- and
byte-level communication away from each specific device class, making it easy to
keep the device class clean while providing a simple way to modify just one class
to port the I2C communication code onto different platforms (Arduino, PIC, simple
bit-banging, etc.).

The code is written to support the Arduino/Wiring implementation, but it may be
useful in other circumstances. The "I2CdevDemo.pde" file is an Arduino IDE sketch
that demonstrates some basic usage of the generic and specific classes.

Documentation for each class is created using Doxygen-style comments placed in
each class definition file, based on the information available in each device's
datasheet.
