The I2C Device Library (i2cdevlib) is a collection of uniform and well-documented classes to provide simple and intuitive interfaces to I2C devices. Each device is built to make use of the generic "i2cdev" class, which abstracts the I2C bit- and byte-level communication away from each specific device class, making it easy to keep the device class clean while providing a simple way to modify just one class to port the I2C communication code onto different platforms (Arduino, PIC, simplebit-banging, etc.).

The code is written to support the Arduino/Wiring implementation, but it may be useful in other circumstances. The "I2CdevDemo.pde" file is an Arduino IDE sketch that demonstrates some basic usage of the generic and specific classes.

Documentation for each class is created using Doxygen-style comments placed in each class definition file, based on the information available in each device's datasheet.

CURRENT COMPLETED DEVICE LIBRARIES:
===================================
- Analog Devices ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer

UPCOMING DEVICE LIBRARIES:
==========================
- InvenSense ITG-3200 3-axis gyroscope
- InvenSense MPU-6050 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope combo
- Honeywell HMC5883L 3-axis magnetometer
- Texas Instruments TCA6424A 24-bit I/O expander

Want something that isn't on the list? Request it, or fork the code and contribute! Better yet, send me a device on a breakout board to test the code during development. No guarantees on how fast I can get it done, but I'd love to make this the biggest I2C device library around.
